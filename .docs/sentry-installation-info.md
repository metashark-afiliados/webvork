|  The Sentry Next.js Wizard will help you set up Sentry for your application.                      |
|  Thank you for using Sentry :)                                                                    |
|                                                                                                   |
|  Version: 6.4.0                                                                                   |

|  This wizard sends telemetry data and crash reports to Sentry. This helps us improve the Wizard.  |
|  You can turn this off at any time by running sentry-wizard --disable-telemetry.                  |
|                                                                                                   |

!  You have uncommitted or untracked files in your repo:
|
|  - .docs-espejo/components/ui/BenefitPill.tsx.md
|
|  The wizard will create and update files.
|
o  Do you want to continue anyway?
|  Yes
|
•  If the browser window didn't open automatically, please open the following link to log into Sentry:
|
|  https://sentry.io/account/settings/wizard/xqjok75sgxdmjvzgvf7fvo5be4as3ivw4sdz7j27la6ogdl1sv3qv5ony70m09wo/?org_slug=metashark-tech&project_slug=javascript-nextjs&project_platform=javascript-nextjs
|
o  Login complete.
|
o  Selected project metashark-tech/javascript-nextjs
|
o  Installed @sentry/nextjs with PNPM.
|
o  Do you want to route Sentry requests in the browser through your Next.js server to avoid ad blockers?
|  No
|
•  Sounds good! We'll leave the option commented for later, just in case :)
|
o  Do you want to enable Tracing to track the performance of your application?
|  Yes
|
o  Do you want to enable Session Replay to get a video-like reproduction of errors during a user session?
|  Yes
|
o  Do you want to enable Logs to send your application logs to Sentry?
|  Yes
|
*  Created fresh sentry.server.config.ts.
|
*  Created fresh sentry.edge.config.ts.
|
*  Added new src\instrumentation.ts file.
|
*  Added new src\instrumentation-client.ts file.
|
o  next.config.mjs already contains Sentry SDK configuration. Should the wizard modify it anyways?
|  Yes
|
*  Updated Sentry configuration in next.config.mjs. (you probably want to clean this up a bit!)
|
*  Created src\app\global-error.tsx.
|
•  It seems like you already have a root layout component. Please add or modify your generateMetadata function.
|
o  Add the following code to your layout.tsx file:


      import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';
      import type { Metadata } from 'next';

      // Add or edit your "generateMetadata" to include the Sentry trace data:
      export function generateMetadata(): Metadata {
        return {
          // ... your existing metadata
          other: {
            ...Sentry.getTraceData()
          }
        };
      }


|
o  Did you apply the snippet above?
|  Yes, continue!
|
o  Do you want to create an example page ("/sentry-example-page") to test your Sentry setup?
|  Yes
|
*  Created src\app\sentry-example-page\page.tsx.
|
*  Created src\app\api\sentry-example-api\route.ts.
|
*  Created .env.sentry-build-plugin with auth token for you to test source map uploading locally.
|
•  .gitignore already has .env.sentry-build-plugin. Will not add it again.
|
o  Are you using a CI/CD tool to build and deploy your application?
|  Yes
|
o  Add the Sentry authentication token as an environment variable to your CI setup:

SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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

|
!  DO NOT commit this auth token to your repository!
|
o  Did you configure CI as shown above?
|  Yes, continue!
|
o  Looks like you have Prettier in your project. Do you want to run it on your files?
|  Yes
|
o  Prettier has formatted your files.
|
o  Optionally add a project-scoped MCP server configuration for the Sentry MCP?
|  What is MCP?
|
•  What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
|
•  MCP is a protocol that allows AI assistants in your IDE to interact with external tools and services.
|
|  The Sentry MCP server enables AI assistants to:
|    • Query and analyze your Sentry issues directly from your IDE
|    • Get context about errors and performance problems
|    • Help debug issues with production data insights
|    • Suggest fixes based on real error patterns
|
|  This makes it easier to fix bugs by bringing Sentry's insights directly into your development workflow.
|
|  Learn more: https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/
|
o  Would you like to configure MCP for your IDE now?
|  Yes
|
o  Which editor do you want to configure?
|  VS Code (project .vscode/mcp.json)
|
*  .vscode\mcp.json created.
|
*  Added project-scoped Sentry MCP configuration.
|
•  Note: You may need to reload your editor for MCP changes to take effect.

SENTRY RULES OFICIAL
These examples should be used as guidance when configuring Sentry functionality within a project.

# Exception Catching

Use `Sentry.captureException(error)` to capture an exception and log the error in Sentry.
Use this in try catch blocks or areas where exceptions are expected

# Tracing Examples

Spans should be created for meaningful actions within an applications like button clicks, API calls, and function calls
Use the `Sentry.startSpan` function to create a span
Child spans can exist within a parent span

## Custom Span instrumentation in component actions

The `name` and `op` properties should be meaninful for the activities in the call.
Attach attributes based on relevant information and metrics from the request

```javascript
function TestComponent() {
  const handleTestButtonClick = () => {
    // Create a transaction/span to measure performance
    Sentry.startSpan(
      {
        op: "ui.click",
        name: "Test Button Click",
      },
      (span) => {
        const value = "some config";
        const metric = "some metric";

        // Metrics can be added to the span
        span.setAttribute("config", value);
        span.setAttribute("metric", metric);

        doSomething();
      },
    );
  };

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleTestButtonClick}>
      Test Sentry
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Custom span instrumentation in API calls

The `name` and `op` properties should be meaninful for the activities in the call.
Attach attributes based on relevant information and metrics from the request

```javascript
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  return Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      op: "http.client",
      name: `GET /api/users/${userId}`,
    },
    async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      return data;
    },
  );
}
```

# Logs

Where logs are used, ensure Sentry is imported using `import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs"`
Enable logging in Sentry using `Sentry.init({ _experiments: { enableLogs: true } })`
Reference the logger using `const { logger } = Sentry`
Sentry offers a consoleLoggingIntegration that can be used to log specific console error types automatically without instrumenting the individual logger calls

## Configuration

In NextJS the client side Sentry initialization is in `instrumentation-client.ts`, the server initialization is in `sentry.edge.config.ts` and the edge initialization is in `sentry.server.config.ts`
Initialization does not need to be repeated in other files, it only needs to happen the files mentioned above. You should use `import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs"` to reference Sentry functionality

### Baseline

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://3b0ee8eeb3bcb81f57ea817b87867e16@o4509967263465472.ingest.de.sentry.io/4509967264776272",

  _experiments: {
    enableLogs: true,
  },
});
```

### Logger Integration

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://3b0ee8eeb3bcb81f57ea817b87867e16@o4509967263465472.ingest.de.sentry.io/4509967264776272",
  integrations: [
    // send console.log, console.warn, and console.error calls as logs to Sentry
    Sentry.consoleLoggingIntegration({ levels: ["log", "warn", "error"] }),
  ],
});
```

## Logger Examples

`logger.fmt` is a template literal function that should be used to bring variables into the structured logs.

```javascript
logger.trace("Starting database connection", { database: "users" });
logger.debug(logger.fmt`Cache miss for user: ${userId}`);
logger.info("Updated profile", { profileId: 345 });
logger.warn("Rate limit reached for endpoint", {
  endpoint: "/api/results/",
  isEnterprise: false,
});
logger.error("Failed to process payment", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  amount: 99.99,
});
logger.fatal("Database connection pool exhausted", {
  database: "users",
  activeConnections: 100,
});
```
